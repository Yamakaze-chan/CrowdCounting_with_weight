# CrowdCounting_with_weight

This model requires GPU for training. So please run "check_cuda.py" to check if your computer has GPU.   
Please use "train.py" for training model. I used ShanghaiTech dataset for training.   
"run_libranet.py" is for predict. Change the value of the variable "img_name" to the path to your picture you want to predict.
